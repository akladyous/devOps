**Amazon S3 Object Lambda** lets you add your own code (like AWS Lambda functions) to process data returned from S3 GET requests. It’s super useful when you want to transform or filter data on the fly *without* modifying the underlying objects.

Here are some **tiny project ideas/use cases** to practice and demonstrate your skills with S3 Object Lambda as a DevOps:

---

### 1. **On-the-fly File Format Conversion**

* Create an S3 Object Lambda function that converts files on the fly — for example, return a JSON file as CSV or vice versa when accessed.
* Use case: You store raw data in one format, but users want it in another format without duplicating files.

---

### 2. **Dynamic Data Redaction**

* Build a Lambda that redacts sensitive info (like PII) dynamically when an object is retrieved.
* Example: Mask email addresses or phone numbers in logs or text files.
* Useful for secure data sharing without changing the original stored files.

---

### 3. **Image Resizing/Thumbnail Generation**

* Implement a Lambda that dynamically resizes or compresses images upon GET requests.
* Use case: Deliver thumbnails or optimized images for different devices from the same original image stored in S3.

---

### 4. **Data Filtering**

* Allow users to request filtered data subsets without downloading the entire file.
* For example, query a CSV file and only return rows matching a certain condition.
* This could integrate with query parameters passed to the Lambda.

---

### 5. **Add Watermarks or Branding**

* Dynamically add watermarks (text or logos) to images or PDFs as they are fetched.
* Great for branding or copyright protection when serving content from S3.

---

### 6. **On-the-fly Compression/Decompression**

* Compress or decompress files during retrieval.
* Useful if you store files uncompressed but want to save bandwidth by delivering compressed content.

---

### 7. **Log Scrubbing or Enhancement**

* When logs are retrieved, enrich them with additional metadata or scrub out debug info dynamically.

---

### Bonus DevOps Twist: **Automate deployment and monitoring**

* Use IaC (Infrastructure as Code) like CloudFormation/Terraform to deploy S3 buckets + Object Lambda functions.
* Setup CI/CD pipelines to update and version Object Lambda code.
* Use CloudWatch metrics and alarms to monitor Lambda performance and errors.
